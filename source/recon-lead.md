# Recon Team

## Description

The Recon lead is in charge of managing the recon group.  The Recon Lead reports to the Operations Lead.

## Missions

The Recon team's tasks are to assign tasks \(from Operations\) to a particular recon unit, report completed tasks to Operations, and to track recon units in the field.

The division of labor between Operations and Recon is: Operations is in charge of deciding what should be done; Recon does the administrative tasks to track and perform the work.

The Recon team will typically consist of three or four people:

* A Recon Lead, in charge of managing the group and accomplishing Recon's goals.
* Recon Net Control Operator (and possibly a scribe)
* A recon assistant / runner

For this document, "Recon Team" refers to Recon personnel working at the ARK.  In addition there are Recon Units which are groups of Recon personnel assigned to perform tasks in the field.
