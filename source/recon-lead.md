# Recon Lead

## **Description**

The Recon lead is in charge of managing the recon group.  Recon reports to the Operations Lead.

## **Missions**

The Recon team's tasks are to assign tasks \(from Operations\) to a particular recon unit, report completed tasks to Operations, and to track recon units in the field.

The division of labor between Operations and Recon is: Operations is in charge of deciding what should be done; Recon does the administrative tasks to track and perform the work.

The Recon team will typically consist of three people:

* A Recon Lead, in charge of managing the group and accomplishing Recon's goals.
* Recon Net Control Operator
* A scribe/runner

For this document, "Recon Team" refers to Recon personnel working at the ARK.  In addition there are Recon Units which are groups of Recon personnel assigned to perform tasks in the field.

## **Responsibilities**

* Get tasks and priorities from Operations
  * Use pre-defined Critical Infrastructure Routes and Zone Groups to simplify "normal" tasks, allowing Operations to focus on unusual / incident specific tasks
* Track each Recon Unit's current assignment
* Track tasks through their lifecycle: unassigned; assigned \(to recon unit\); complete
* Report completed tasks to Operations
* Receive incident reports from Recon Units
  * Assign incident numbers
  * Forward incident reports to Operations
